# Floating Move Register

X-Form

* fmr FRT,FRB (Rc=0)
* fmr. FRT,FRB (Rc=1)

Pseudo-code:

    FRT <- FRB[0:63]

Special Registers Altered:

    CR1          (if Rc=1)

# Floating Absolute Value Register

X-Form

* fabs FRT,FRB (Rc=0)
* fabs. FRT,FRB (Rc=1)

Pseudo-code:

    FRT <- 0b0 || FRB[1:63]

Special Registers Altered:

    CR1          (if Rc=1)

# Floating Negative Absolute Value Register

X-Form

* fnabs FRT,FRB (Rc=0)
* fnabs. FRT,FRB (Rc=1)

Pseudo-code:

    FRT <- 0b1 || FRB[1:63]

Special Registers Altered:

    CR1          (if Rc=1)

# Floating Negate Register

X-Form

* fneg FRT,FRB (Rc=0)
* fneg. FRT,FRB (Rc=1)

Pseudo-code:

    FRT <- Â¬FRB[0] || FRB[1:63]

Special Registers Altered:

    CR1          (if Rc=1)

# Floating Copy Sign  Register

X-Form

* fcpsgn FRT,FRA,FRB (Rc=0)
* fcpsgn. FRT,FRA,FRB (Rc=1)

Pseudo-code:

    FRT <- FRA[0] || FRB[1:63]

Special Registers Altered:

    CR1          (if Rc=1)

# [DRAFT] Floating Move To GPR

X-Form

* mffpr RT,FRB (Rc=0)
* mffpr. RT,FRB (Rc=1)

Pseudo-code:

    RT <- (FRB)

Special Registers Altered:

    CR0          (if Rc=1)

# [DRAFT] Floating Move To GPR Single

X-Form

* mffprs RT,FRB (Rc=0)
* mffprs. RT,FRB (Rc=1)

Pseudo-code:

    RT <- [0] * (XLEN/2) || SINGLE((FRB))  # SINGLE since that's what stfs uses

Special Registers Altered:

    CR0          (if Rc=1)

# [DRAFT] Floating Move From GPR

X-Form

* mtfpr FRT,RB

Pseudo-code:

    FRT <- (RB)

Special Registers Altered:

    None

# [DRAFT] Floating Move From GPR Single

X-Form

* mtfprs FRT,RB

Pseudo-code:

    FRT <- DOUBLE((RB)[XLEN/2:XLEN-1])  # DOUBLE since that's what lfs uses

Special Registers Altered:

    None
