# Store Byte with Post-Update

D-Form

* stbup RS,D(RA)

Pseudo-code:

    EA <- (RA) + EXTS(D)
    ea <- (RA)
    MEM(ea, 1) <- (RS)[XLEN-8:XLEN-1]
    RA <- EA

Description:

    Let the effective address (EA) be the sum (RA)+ D.
    (RS)[56:63] are stored into the byte in storage addressed
    by RA.

    EA is placed into register RA.

    If RA=0, the instruction form is invalid.

Special Registers Altered:

    None

# Store Byte with Post-Update Indexed

X-Form

* stbupx RS,RA,RB

Pseudo-code:

    EA <- (RA) + (RB)
    ea <- (RA)
    MEM(ea, 1) <- (RS)[XLEN-8:XLEN-1]
    RA <- EA

Description:

    Let the effective address (EA) be the sum (RA)+ (RB).
    (RS)[56:63] are stored into the byte in storage addressed
    by EA.

    EA is placed into register RA.

    If RA=0, the instruction form is invalid.

Special Registers Altered:

    None

# Store Halfword with Post-Update

D-Form

* sthup RS,D(RA)

Pseudo-code:

    EA <- (RA) + EXTS(D)
    ea <- (RA)
    MEM(ea, 2) <- (RS)[XLEN-16:XLEN-1]
    RA <- EA

Description:

    Let the effective address (EA) be the sum (RA|0)+ D.
    (RS)[48:63] are stored into the halfword in storage
    addressed by EA.

Special Registers Altered:

    None

# Store Halfword with Post-Update Indexed

X-Form

* sthupx RS,RA,RB

Pseudo-code:

    EA <- (RA) + (RB)
    ea <- (RA)
    MEM(ea, 2) <- (RS)[XLEN-16:XLEN-1]
    RA <- EA

Description:

    Let the effective address (EA) be the sum (RA)+ (RB).
    (RS)[56:63] are stored into the byte in storage addressed
    by EA.

    EA is placed into register RA.

    If RA=0, the instruction form is invalid

Special Registers Altered:

    None

# Store Word with Post-Update

D-Form

* stwup RS,D(RA)

Pseudo-code:

    EA <- (RA) + EXTS(D)
    ea <- (RA)
    MEM(ea, 4) <- (RS)[XLEN-32:XLEN-1]
    RA <- EA

Description:

    Let the effective address (EA) be the sum (RA)+ D.
    (RS)[32:63] are stored into the word in storage addressed
    by EA.

    EA is placed into register RA.

    If RA=0, the instruction form is invalid.

Special Registers Altered:

    None

# Store Word with Post-Update Indexed

X-Form

* stwupx RS,RA,RB

Pseudo-code:

    EA <- (RA) + (RB)
    ea <- (RA)
    MEM(ea, 4) <- (RS)[XLEN-32:XLEN-1]
    RA <- EA

Description:

    Let the effective address (EA) be the sum (RA)+ (RB).
    (RS)[32:63] are stored into the word in storage addressed
    by RA.

    EA is placed into register RA.

    If RA=0, the instruction form is invalid.

Special Registers Altered:

    None

# Store Doubleword with Post-Update

DS-Form

* stdup RS,DS(RA)

Pseudo-code:

    EA <- (RA) + EXTS(DS || 0b00)
    ea <- (RA)
    MEM(ea, 8) <- (RS)
    RA <- EA

Description:

    Let the effective address (EA) be the sum
    (RA)+ (DS||0b00). (RS) is stored into the doubleword in
    storage addressed by RA.

    EA is placed into register RA.

    If RA=0, the instruction form is invalid.

Special Registers Altered:

    None

# Store Doubleword with Post-Update Indexed

X-Form

* stdupx RS,RA,RB

Pseudo-code:

    EA <- (RA) + (RB)
    ea <- (RA)
    MEM(ea, 8) <- (RS)
    RA <- EA

Description:

    Let the effective address (EA) be the sum (RA)+ (RB).
    (RS) is stored into the doubleword in storage
    addressed by RA.

    EA is placed into register RA.

    If RA=0, the instruction form is invalid.

Special Registers Altered:

    None
