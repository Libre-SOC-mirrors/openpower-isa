# Store Byte Shifted Indexed

X-Form

* stbsx RS,RA,RB,SH

Pseudo-code:

    b <- (RA|0)
    EA <- b + (RB) << (SH+1)
    MEM(EA, 1) <- (RS)[XLEN-8:XLEN-1]

Description:

    Let the effective address (EA) be the sum of the contents of
    register RB shifted by (SH+1) and (RA|0).
    RS [56:63] are stored into the byte in storage addressed by EA.

Special Registers Altered:

    None

# Store Byte Shifted with Update Indexed

X-Form

* stbsux RS,RA,RB,SH

Pseudo-code:

    EA <- (RA) + (RB) << (SH+1)
    MEM(EA, 1) <- (RS)[XLEN-8:XLEN-1]

Description:

    Let the effective address (EA) be the sum of the contents of
    register RB shifted by (SH+1) and (RA).
    RS[56:63] are stored into the byte in storage addressed
    by EA.

    EA <- b + (RB) << (SH+1)
    MEM(EA, 4) <- (RS)[XLEN-32:XLEN-1]

Description:

    Let the effective address (EA) be the sum
    (RA|0)+ (RB). RS[32:63] are stored into the word in stor-
    age addressed by EA.

Special Registers Altered:

    None

# Store Word Shifted with Update Indexed

X-Form

* stwsux RS,RA,RB,SH

Pseudo-code:

    EA <- (RA) + (RB) << (SH+1)
    MEM(EA, 4) <- (RS)[XLEN-32:XLEN-1]
    RA <- EA

Description:

    Let the effective address (EA) be the sum (RA)+ (RB).
    RS[32:63] are stored into the word in storage addressed
    by EA.

    EA is placed into register RA.

    If RA=0, the instruction form is invalid.

Special Registers Altered:

    None
