# Store Floating-Point Single

D-Form

* stfs FRS,D(RA)

Pseudo-code:

    EA <- (RA|0) + EXTS(D)
    MEM(EA, 4)<- SINGLE( (FRS) )

Description:

    Let the effective address (EA) be the sum (RA|0)+D.

    The contents of register FRS are converted to single
    format (see page 142) and stored into the word in stor-
    age addressed by EA.

Special Registers Altered:

    None

# Store Floating-Point Single Indexed

X-Form

* stfsx FRS,RA,RB

Pseudo-code:

    EA <- (RA|0) + (RB)
    MEM(EA, 4)<- SINGLE( (FRS) )

Description:

    Let the effective address (EA) be the sum (RA|0)+(RB).

    The contents of register FRS are converted to single
    format (see page 142) and stored into the word in stor-
    age addressed by EA.

Special Registers Altered:

    None

# Store Floating-Point Single with Update

D-Form

* stfsu FRS,D(RA)

Pseudo-code:

    EA <- (RA) + EXTS(D)
    MEM(EA, 4)<- SINGLE( (FRS) )
    RA <- EA

Description:

    Let the effective address (EA) be the sum (RA) +D.

    The contents of register FRS are converted to single
    format (see page 142) and stored into the word in stor-
    age addressed by EA.

    EA is placed into register RA.

    If RA=0, the instruction form is invalid.

Special Registers Altered:

    None

# Store Floating-Point Single with Update Indexed

X-Form

* stfsux FRS,RA,RB

Pseudo-code:

    EA <- (RA) + (RB)
    MEM(EA, 4)<- SINGLE( (FRS) )
    RA <- EA

Description:

    Let the effective address (EA) be the sum (RA) +(RB).

    The contents of register FRS are converted to single
    format (see page 142) and stored into the word in stor-
    age addressed by EA.

    EA is placed into register RA.

    If RA=0, the instruction form is invalid.

Special Registers Altered:

    None

# Store Floating-Point Double

D-Form

* stfd FRS,D(RA)

Pseudo-code:

    EA <- (RA|0) + EXTS(D)
    MEM(EA, 8)<- (FRS) 

Description:

    Let the effective address (EA) be the sum (RA|0)+D.

    The contents of register FRS are stored into the dou-
    bleword in storage addressed by EA.

Special Registers Altered:

    None

# Store Floating-Point Double Indexed

X-Form

* stfdx FRS,RA,RB

Pseudo-code:

    EA <- (RA|0) + (RB)
    MEM(EA, 8)<- (FRS) 

Description:

    Let the effective address (EA) be the sum (RA|0)+(RB).

    The contents of register FRS are stored into the dou-
    bleword in storage addressed by EA.

Special Registers Altered:

    None

# Store Floating-Point Double with Update

D-Form

* stfdu FRS,D(RA)

Pseudo-code:

    EA <- (RA) + EXTS(D)
    MEM(EA, 8)<- (FRS) 
    RA <- EA

Special Registers Altered:

    None

# Store Floating-Point Double with Update Indexed

X-Form

* stfdux FRS,RA,RB

Pseudo-code:

    EA <- (RA) + (RB)
    MEM(EA, 8)<- (FRS) 
    RA <- EA

Special Registers Altered:

    None

# Store Floating-Point as Integer Word Indexed 

X-Form

* stfiwx FRS,RA,RB

Pseudo-code:

    b <- (RA|0)
    EA <- b + (RB)
    MEM(EA, 8)<- (FRS)[32:63]

Special Registers Altered:

    None
