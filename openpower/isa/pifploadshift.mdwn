# Load Floating-Point Single with Post-Update

D-Form

* lfsup FRT,D(RA)

Pseudo-code:

    EA <- (RA) + EXTS(D)
    FRT <- DOUBLE(MEM(RA, 4))
    RA <- EA

Description:

    Let the effective address (EA) be the sum (RA)+D.

    The word in storage addressed by EA is interpreted as
    a floating-point single-precision operand. This word is
    converted to floating-point double format (see
    page 138) and placed into register FRT.

    EA is placed into register RA.

    If RA=0, the instruction form is invalid.

Special Registers Altered:

    None

# Load Floating-Point Single with Post-Update Indexed

X-Form

* lfsupx FRT,RA,RB

Pseudo-code:

    EA <- (RA) + (RB)
    FRT <- DOUBLE(MEM(RA, 4))
    RA <- EA

Description:

    Let the effective address (EA) be the sum (RA)+(RB).

    The word in storage addressed by EA is interpreted as
    a floating-point single-precision operand. This word is
    converted to floating-point double format (see
    page 138) and placed into register FRT.

    EA is placed into register RA.

    If RA=0, the instruction form is invalid.

Special Registers Altered:

    None

# Load Floating-Point Double with Post-Update

D-Form

* lfdup FRT,D(RA)

Pseudo-code:

    EA <- (RA) + EXTS(D)
    FRT <- MEM(RA, 8)
    RA <- EA

Description:

    Let the effective address (EA) be the sum (RA)+D.

    The doubleword in storage addressed by EA is loaded
    into register FRT.

    EA is placed into register RA.

    If RA=0, the instruction form is invalid.

Special Registers Altered:

    None

# Load Floating-Point Double with Post-Update Indexed

X-Form

* lfduxp FRT,RA,RB

Pseudo-code:

    EA <- (RA) + (RB)
    FRT <- MEM(RA, 8)
    RA <- EA

Description:

    Let the effective address (EA) be the sum (RA)+(RB).

    The doubleword in storage addressed by EA is loaded
    into register FRT.

    EA is placed into register RA.

    If RA=0, the instruction form is invalid.

Special Registers Altered:

    None
